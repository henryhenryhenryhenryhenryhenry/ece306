# intro-to-embedded-systems

this is all the code required to make a two wheeled robot that you can control via wifi
it can also be sent into an autonomous mode where it follows a black line on the floor

a ti launchpad dev board with an MSP430FR5994 processor was used for this project
additional hardware used:
-custom h-bridge to drive motors
-two brushed dc motors to provide propulsion
-IR emmitter & detectors to follow black line
-LCD display
-custom 3.3v power converter
-GS2101MIP wifi module
-4x 1.5v AA batteries

if you are a current intro to embedded systems student, I encourage you to not directly copy
  this code as it was documented well enough for me to understand, but possibly not well 
  enough for someone else to do so
